Specifics of the Infrastructure:

Server: A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides resources, services, or data to other computers or users over a network.

Domain Name: The domain name (www.foobar.com) is a human-readable label used to identify a website on the internet. It serves as an easy-to-remember alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

DNS Record: The "www" in www.foobar.com is a subdomain and is typically configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record in DNS, which points to the domain's main A record (foobar.com) or directly to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

Web Server: Nginx serves as the entry point for incoming HTTP requests, handling static content delivery and acting as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: The application server executes dynamic code to generate web pages and interacts with the database to retrieve or store data. It handles the logic and processing required to fulfill user requests.

Database: MySQL stores and manages website/application data in a structured manner, facilitating efficient retrieval and storage of information.

Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP protocol. When a user requests a webpage, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested content.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in hardware, software, or network connectivity can lead to downtime for the entire website.

Downtime during Maintenance: Performing maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or updating server configurations may require restarting services like the web server, leading to temporary downtime for users.

Scalability Limitations: The infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in traffic. Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) becomes challenging due to the tightly coupled nature of components on a single server. Vertical scaling (upgrading server resources) has limits and may not be cost-effective in the long run.
